Somehow it doesn't play like that. Why? Maybe it's because McKellar, adapting screenwriters Ken Scott and Michael Dowse and his ensemble cast favor subtlety. The actors put across funny bits with a deadpan reaction or awkward pause, instead of hammering them home by indulging in double takes or hitting key words hard. Gleeson in particular has an uncanny ability to wring laughs from lines that, on paper, aren't innately funny, by delivering them as if they were just another thing to say.</description></item><item><title>Brian Laundries notebook, explained</title><link>/brian-laundries-notebook-explained.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brian-laundries-notebook-explained.html</guid><description>Content advisory: This article contains references to intimate partner violence and homicide.
