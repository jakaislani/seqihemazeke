The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office told detectives on Sunday that the body of a lady had been discovered on Drowning Creek Road in Gwinnett County. Authorities identified the body as that of Lafakis, a mother and grandmother.</p><p>Brandon Wineinger, her ex-boyfriend, was arrested Saturday morning on suspicion of kidnapping, hiding the death of another person, tampering with evidence, making false statements, and first-degree robbery. “Wineinger was interviewed at police headquarters and during the course of the interview made several statements that were proven to be false,” Brookhaven police said in a statement that only listed one of the allegations.</p><p>“Wineinger was interviewed at police headquarters and during the course of the interview made several statements that were proven to be false,” Brookhaven police said in a statement that only referenced his false statements and tampering with evidence charges. According to the publication, Gwinnett County investigators also interviewed Wineinger and charged him with a cover-up.</p><h4>Report of Investigation</h4><p>According to Atlanta News First, police detained him after interviewing multiple family members and others close to Lafakis. Lafakis was meant to have supper with her daughter Friday night, who went to her mother’s house when she didn’t show up or answer her phone. Lafakis’ car was visible to the daughter, but her mother was not present.</p><p>The woman’s daughters and granddaughter were her entire existence, according to her bereaved family. “She was very proud of them, and the bond they shared was unique and special.”</p><p>“They will make her proud and live the lives she has always desired for them.” Many people adored her, and her legacy will be the way she lived. “She was genuine, funny, loyal and simply a force of nature,” they continued. Authorities are currently investigating the cause of death and have stated that additional charges may be brought.</p><p>Wineinger appeared in court for the first time on Monday and is being held at the DeKalb County Jail. As of Tuesday morning, a GoFundMe site set up for Lafakis’ girls had garnered more than $9,000 in donations. “Aimee was tragically removed from the family.”</p><p>“Last weekend, Aimee was brutally removed from her daughter’s (SIC). The goal of this account is to assist her daughters during this trying time. Please allow all of Aimee’s love to be expressed via love and support for her girls,” her sister DeeAnn wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7wKKknp1doa6nrcqiqmaen6q7pXnDnpidZZ2ewLS1zaBkr6GTqbauecWorKecXZmyorCMqKVmrJiaerO7wJ1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faimee-lafakis-found-dead-missing-victim-found-dead-on-the-road.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faimee-lafakis-found-dead-missing-victim-found-dead-on-the-road.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faimee-lafakis-found-dead-missing-victim-found-dead-on-the-road.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faimee-lafakis-found-dead-missing-victim-found-dead-on-the-road.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faimee-lafakis-found-dead-missing-victim-found-dead-on-the-road.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faimee-lafakis-found-dead-missing-victim-found-dead-on-the-road.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cindy-prado-ethnicity-and-boyfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cindy-prado-ethnicity-and-boyfriend.html>Cindy Prado | Ethnicity And Boyfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./yo-yo-net-worth-213644.html>Yo-Yo Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./yo-yo-net-worth-213644.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
