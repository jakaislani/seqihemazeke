The longtime host of Wild 94.9 of Bay Area was reported missing a week ago just hours after he went on-air and opened up about his health problems and difficulties in treatment.</p><p>On Wednesday, March 2, Yi, who is also a host of 94.9, shared an update to the station's Instagram detailing the missing <a href=#>radio presenter</a>'s struggle he underwent with <a href=#>Lyme disease</a> diagnosed in 2021. "The amount of compassion for the physical torture JV has been going through for the past 2 years has been overwhelming," she said and added, "I have been in so much pain and fear and I know all of you have been so scared and concerned for JV as well."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>Joshua 'JJ' Rowland: Missing Florida boy, 2, found alive by retired marine Roy Link after 24 hours</a></p><p><a href=#>DJ Flavinha suffers first-degree burns in freak confetti cannon accident during concert</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Natasha Yi?</h2><p>Born in 1979 in Massachusetts, Natasha Yi who is also on The JV Show was known for modeling for huge brands including Playboy, Vanity Fair, and Maxim. Yi is known as the first Asian-American to become one of The Price is Right's Barker's Beauties. For the campaigns of brands including <a href=#>McDonald's</a>, Sony, Pepsi, Regis hair, Marriott Hotels, and many others, Yi has been part of their print ads and commercials. Yi and Vandergrift met in 2003 and tied the knot in 2006, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Last FM</a>. She is also a part of her husband's show 'The Dog House'.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'JV will not be coming back'</h2><p>In the statement released by Yi, she referred to the radio community and wrote, "JV and I have always considered this community part of our family, so I want to let you know that personal information has recently been discovered" and revealed that the information has led them to believe "JV will not be coming back." She wrote, "I tell you this with incredible pain and sadness in my heart."</p><p>"We are incredibly appreciative for the SFPD’s ongoing efforts in locating JV and they have asked us to keep the details to immediate family only. I know how painful this is for you to hear — please know that I have you in my thoughts," she wrote. Though the new information was released, Vandergrift is still considered missing by the San Francisco Police Department and no foul play is suspected. However, the police considered him to be "at risk."</p><p>The long-time host previously shared with his listeners during the morning show on Thursday about his ongoing Lyme disease condition. He said, "The stuff I’ve been going through in my brain that they’re trying to figure out. The body and the pain and all that stuff, I can handle. What it’s doing to my brain I could never describe to you." According to a post on the station's website detailing Vandergrift's diagnosis,&nbsp;he endured "brain fog,” headaches, dizziness, extreme bouts of depression, and other adverse symptoms" for months, "before he learned what was wrong."&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you for a wonderful life-filed w joy, laughs, pain & struggle. It’s been a great journey," read the missing DJ's notably edited caption of his post on Instagram before he was reported missing while his Twitter location read "the other side" at the time of his disappearance.</p><p>Vandergrift has been described by the police as a brown-eyed, 6-foot bald white man weighing approximately 180 pounds. He was last seen wearing black sweatpants and has one tattoo above his right ear and several tattoos on his arms, reported <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWbs7Ox2Gahr2WmlrulsdGgqaKepGK6qr%2FSoqWgZaOWu26y0ZqlnKGjmLxusIyjqmavmZuybrrArZisoJFixqp50pqwrGWYmnq4tculZKenpGKvpnnCqKSippdir6Kvyg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeffrey-jv-vandergrift-missing-san-francisco-d-js-wife-natasha-yi-says-he-will-not-be-coming-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeffrey-jv-vandergrift-missing-san-francisco-d-js-wife-natasha-yi-says-he-will-not-be-coming-back.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeffrey-jv-vandergrift-missing-san-francisco-d-js-wife-natasha-yi-says-he-will-not-be-coming-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeffrey-jv-vandergrift-missing-san-francisco-d-js-wife-natasha-yi-says-he-will-not-be-coming-back.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeffrey-jv-vandergrift-missing-san-francisco-d-js-wife-natasha-yi-says-he-will-not-be-coming-back.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeffrey-jv-vandergrift-missing-san-francisco-d-js-wife-natasha-yi-says-he-will-not-be-coming-back.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sam-kiszka.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sam-kiszka.html>Sam Kiszka</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./becky-g-biography-net-worth-age-boyfriend-songs-and-movies.html>Becky G Biography; Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Songs And Movies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./becky-g-biography-net-worth-age-boyfriend-songs-and-movies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
