As with many pop-culture figures, some overly hyped aspects of Monroe's story — such as her reputation as a "dumb blonde" and the mystery around her death — have often overshadowed other aspects of her legacy. Here are six fascinating facts about her life that reveal a more nuanced picture of the real woman behind the legend:</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Monroe cut her honeymoon short to entertain the troops</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the early years of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War II</a>, Monroe was a teenaged housewife named Norma Jeane Dougherty. During the war, she went to work in a factory that made military drones. There, she was discovered by a photographer searching for subjects to inspire the troops. Monroe became a model and went on to take risqué pin-up photos that would be hugely popular with soldiers in Korea. After she'd transformed into an actress called Marilyn Monroe, army publication Stars & Stripes dubbed her "Miss Cheesecake of 1951" as her film career was taking off.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Monroe demonstrated her gratitude to these fans by interrupting her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/marilyn-monroe-joe-dimaggio-relationship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=honeymoon class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">honeymoon</a> with second husband <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/joe-dimaggio data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe DiMaggio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joe DiMaggio</a> to visit troops in Korea in February 1954. Her routine, which featured her onstage in a sparkling purple dress, was a huge hit. She did 10 shows in four days, despite freezing temperatures that contributed to her developing pneumonia. Monroe later noted the experience "was the best thing that ever happened to me. I never felt like a star before in my heart."</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Becoming an A-List movie start didn't come easy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As she started out in the movie industry, Monroe did submit to the casting couch. However, she also worked hard by taking lessons and giving her all to the parts that came her way. To gain experience for a role in B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948), she performed in a burlesque show under the name "Mona Monroe." For a working-class role in the film Clash by Night (1952), she observed workers in a cannery (and apparently was offered a job beheading fish).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Monroe certainly didn't experience overnight success — she cycled through a couple of movie studios, and saw film contracts expire. But she was always prepared to triumph in her career. At one point she told a friend, "If one hundred percent of the movie big shots in Hollywood told me I couldn’t make it to the top, I wouldn’t believe them."</p><img alt="Marilyn Monroe Photo Gallery: Marilyn performing for American servicemen in Korea in February of 1954.

Artists who refused to reveal people who'd been involved with Communist activities could be sent to prison for contempt of Congress, but Miller refused to name names. Throughout this ordeal, Monroe remained committed to Miller — despite studio executives and acting teacher Paula Strasberg warning that her decision could expose Monroe to a public backlash that might destroy her career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Monroe also agreed to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marilyn-monroe-arthur-miller-relationship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="marry Miller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">marry Miller</a>, even after he surprised her by announcing their wedding plans in his HUAC testimony. Her public display of loyalty likely helped keep him out of prison (Miller was given a suspended sentence for his contempt conviction in 1957; the conviction went on to be overturned in 1958). However, Monroe's actions ended up attracting further interest: Support of Miller, combined with a request she'd made to visit the Soviet Union in 1955 (though she didn't make the trip), prompted the FBI to open a file on her.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Monroe was an advocate for civil rights</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her relationship with Miller, which ended in divorce in 1961, wasn't the only means by which Monroe became politically aware. With Shelley Winters, a one-time roommate, Monroe attended rallies protesting the violation of civil liberties caused by anti-Communist fervor. She was once chastised for reading a "radical" biography of muckraker Lincoln Steffens on a film set. Having been raised to hold more progressive views on race, Monroe also became an advocate for civil rights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1960, Monroe was elected as an alternate delegate to Connecticut's state Democratic convention (it was a largely honorary position and she didn't attend the gathering). She also once said to reporters, "My nightmare is the H-bomb. What's yours?" — making it unsurprising that she got involved with the Hollywood arm of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. The FBI, which continued to keep tabs on her, noted in her file in 1962: "Subject's views are very positively and concisely leftist; however, if she is being actively used by the Communist Party, it is not general knowledge among those working with the movement in Los Angeles."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She was institutionalized in 1961</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Monroe had a lifelong fear of losing her sanity, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marilyn-monroe-mother-relationship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="something she'd witnessed in her mother" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">something she'd witnessed in her mother</a>. So when Dr. Marianne Kris brought Monroe — who was taking pills, losing weight and not sleeping — to a locked and padded room in New York’s Payne Whitney Clinic in 1961, the patient reacted badly. Desperate to escape, Monroe took inspiration from one of her early films, broke a window and threatened to cut herself with a piece of glass.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This behavior led to Monroe being restrained and carried to another level of the facility, and her desperation grew. Dr. Kris didn't visit; Monroe wrote to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lee-strasberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Lee class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lee</a> and Paula Strasberg, her acting teachers, but they weren't able to obtain her release. Only ex-husband DiMaggio came through, rushing to the facility when he learned what was happening. "I want my wife," he demanded, "And if you do not release her to me, I will take this place apart — piece of wood, by piece . . . of . . . wood." Of course, Monroe was no longer DiMaggio's wife, but the hospital felt the most prudent course was to avoid any potential negative publicity. She was transferred to Columbia University Presbyterian Hospital, where she received treatment in a private room.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Monroe was incredibly generous</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Monroe was generous throughout her life, a trait that was apparent even as she spent time in institutions and foster homes. She gave an acting teacher a valuable fur coat and offered money to people in need; shopping companions would often find Monroe had sent them items she'd ostensibly purchased for herself. She was especially generous with children and offered assistance to child-focused charities like the Milk Fund for Babies and the March of Dimes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same generosity continues even after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marilyn-monroe-final-days data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Monroe's death" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Monroe's death</a>. Though most of Monroe's estate went to Strasberg, a portion was left to Dr. Kris. In 1980, Kris bequeathed her part of Monroe's estate to England's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.annafreud.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anna Freud Centre" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Anna Freud Centre</a>. This organization serves children with mental health issues — given her life experiences, it's a cause Monroe would likely be proud to support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwucCroKWxnmK6sLrRqJxmmpmktLOtz6GwZp6RmMG0</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarilyn-monroe-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarilyn-monroe-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarilyn-monroe-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarilyn-monroe-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarilyn-monroe-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarilyn-monroe-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./get-your-cereal-crocs-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./get-your-cereal-crocs-now.html>General Mills Is Making Cereal Crocs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zoe-cristofoli.html>Zoe Cristofoli- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zoe-cristofoli.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
