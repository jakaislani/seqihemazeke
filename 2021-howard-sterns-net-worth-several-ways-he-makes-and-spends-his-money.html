He began his career in 1975, working for various radio stations across America in Detroit, Washington D.C, Hartford and a few others.</p><p>Known for his show, The Howard Stern Show which began in 1979 at WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut, Howard developed a reputation as a controversial and extremely fun personality in the early days of his career that made him a cash cow for every radio station he worked for, improving their audience ratings and bringing in advertising revenue.</p><p>One of his longest partnerships was with WXRK, where he hosted The Howard Stern Show for 20 years from 1985 to 2005. The show earned national syndication in 1986 and was aired in 60 markets with over 20 million listeners.</p><p>Howard Stern’s ability to command such a large audience power eventually got him the biggest contributor to his net worth, a syndication deal with Sirius Broadcasting for $500 million, that saw him leave terrestrial radio for satellite radio. The five-year contract made him one of the highest earners in radio’s history and he resigned with the broadcasting company in 2015 for another mega-deal.</p><p>Before his deal with the company, aside from his salary from contracts with his previous radio stations, he made money from hosting pay-per-view event like, Howard Stern’s Negligee and Underpants Party which grossed $1.2 million. Also, several of his antics on the radio were filmed and sold in video stores, many of which sold out.</p><p>During his time with WXRK, which was owned by Infinity Broadcasting, he signed contracts worth over $10 million and the TV version of his show, The Howard Stern Show on WWOR-TV was one of the highest-rated variety shows between 1991 and 1992, regularly beating Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Other ways Howard Stern has made money and earned his huge net worth include writing and publishing a couple of books. He signed a $1 million deal to publish his first book, Private Parts, one that was eventually adapted for film and made over $40 million at the box office.</p><p>His second book fetched him $3 million in advance fee and he has appeared on America’s Got Talent, where he earned $15 million per year between the seventh and tenth season of the show. As an all-round media personality, he has also made money from other means like photography and music.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-howard-stern-spend-his-money></span><strong>How Does Howard Stern Spend His Money?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With a net worth of over $600 million, Howard Stern’s purchase options are virtually unlimited and he has spent his money on a few choice items. He once spent $52 million on a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. He once owned a summer home in Long Island he bought for $5.5 million, which he sold for $7.6 million. Howard also owns an apartment in the Millennium Tower, one of the most expensive apartment buildings in New York City.</p><p>Spending on luxurious items is not the only thing Howard Stern has used his net worth for. He has also spent $2.5 million in fines to the Federal Communications Commission, accounting for half of the commission’s fines between 1990 and 2004.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35utM6wmKucXajBpr7NrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkrJ2mmr%2BiuIywmLKrXZ2ybrnApJysZZGjsW6%2Fz56lnatdnba0ecyopZ6xXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2021-howard-sterns-net-worth-several-ways-he-makes-and-spends-his-money.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2021-howard-sterns-net-worth-several-ways-he-makes-and-spends-his-money.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2021-howard-sterns-net-worth-several-ways-he-makes-and-spends-his-money.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2021-howard-sterns-net-worth-several-ways-he-makes-and-spends-his-money.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2021-howard-sterns-net-worth-several-ways-he-makes-and-spends-his-money.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2021-howard-sterns-net-worth-several-ways-he-makes-and-spends-his-money.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ryan-abe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ryan-abe.html>Ryan Abe- Bio, Age, Ethnicity, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Dating</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-do-you-fix-levolor-accordia-cellular-shades-html.html>How do you fix Levolor Accordia Cellular Shades?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-do-you-fix-levolor-accordia-cellular-shades-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
