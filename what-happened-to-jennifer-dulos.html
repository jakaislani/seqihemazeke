This article delves into the details of the case, the investigations that followed, and the impact it has had on her community and family.</p><h2 id=background-of-jennifer-dulos-LgmSjbBcfw>Background of Jennifer Dulos</h2><p>Jennifer Dulos was a 50-year-old writer and mother living in New Canaan, Connecticut. She was in the midst of a contentious divorce and custody battle with her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos. The couple had been married for over a decade and had five children together. Jennifer had filed for divorce in 2017, citing irreconcilable differences and fearing for her safety.</p><h2 id=the-disappearance-LgmSjbBcfw>The Disappearance</h2><p>On May 24, 2019, Jennifer dropped her children off at school in the morning. This was the last confirmed sighting of her. Later that day, she missed several appointments and was reported missing by friends. Her vehicle, a black Chevrolet Suburban, was found abandoned near a park not far from her home.</p><h2 id=initial-search-and-investigation-LgmSjbBcfw>Initial Search and Investigation</h2><p>Following her disappearance, local law enforcement, along with state police and the FBI, launched an extensive search operation.
