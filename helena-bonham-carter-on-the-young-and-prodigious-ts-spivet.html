<time>06 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><b>Although a couple of the Harry Potter movies and "Alice in Wonderland" were released in 3-D, I think this is the first film that you have actually shot in the process.</b></p><p>We had these massive cameras and there were certain things that you couldn't do. Sometimes you couldn't move too quickly if you were too close but there was no way that you forget that the camera was there because it was so enormous. It was quite inviting because everyone would disappear into the tent and you could see what it was like in 3-D. There were certain colors that we couldn't use and certain gestures that were done deliberately for the 3-D effect that were great fun with my implements and my insects. It is quite spectacular in 3-D and a totally different experience--like going on a holiday without having to pack or find your passport. It also allowed you to get inside of T.S.'s mind and, in a way, into Jean-Pierre's mind.</p><p><b>"The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet" was released in Europe about a year or so ago but the American release was delayed for a long time, reportedly due to difficulties between Jeunet and the Weinstein Company, and when it finally did come out earlier this month, it was without any publicity or press screenings and only in 2-D. For you, how frustrating is it to have to sit and watch this happen, especially with a film that could actually attract a decent audience if given even a bit of a chance?</b></p><p>It is very frustrating but at least it is coming out and that is all that I can say. It could have just been dumped on video but at least it is being given a chance. But no, it has been frustrating.</p><p><b>In your next film, this fall's "Suffragette," you appear alongside <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a> and <a href=#>Carey Mulligan</a> in the story of the fight for women to get the right to vote in England</b>.</p><p>I'm playing a character called Edith Ellyn and what is peculiar for me is that I am playing a suffragette and the prime minister at the time was Asquith, who is, or was, my great-grandfather and the last liberal prime minister. I always thought that he was a good one but in playing a suffragette, I saw him from a different light. I saw someone who wasn't going for that vote. In the film, which is hilarious, even though they had to cut the scene,&nbsp; I got to throw horse dung at my great-grandfather along with a lot of suffragettes who were trying to attack and terrorize him.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqmiglaGyr62Mm6anoJGieqSt0a2cq2Wfo3q1tMRmsKitnpx6orrDZqerp5SetKq71KxkratdqL2qwsSt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhelena-bonham-carter-on-the-young-and-prodigious-ts-spivet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhelena-bonham-carter-on-the-young-and-prodigious-ts-spivet.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhelena-bonham-carter-on-the-young-and-prodigious-ts-spivet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhelena-bonham-carter-on-the-young-and-prodigious-ts-spivet.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhelena-bonham-carter-on-the-young-and-prodigious-ts-spivet.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhelena-bonham-carter-on-the-young-and-prodigious-ts-spivet.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lanny-poffo-cause-of-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lanny-poffo-cause-of-death.html>Lanny Poffos Cause Of Death How Did He Die?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-do-bts-wear-face-masks.html>Why do BTS wear face masks?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-do-bts-wear-face-masks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
