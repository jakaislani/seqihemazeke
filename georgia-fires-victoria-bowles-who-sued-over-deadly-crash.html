Devin Willock and another recruiting staffer has been fired by the school.</p><p>Victoria Bowles <a href=#>sued the school</a> and former Bulldogs star Jalen Carter last month over the car crash, which occurred Jan. 15 in Athens, Ga., shortly after a parade celebrating the Bulldogs’ national championship.</p><p>Another recruiting staff member, Chandler LeCroy, was reportedly racing a school-leased SUV against Carter prior to the crash.</p><p>Carter was selected ninth-overall in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Eagles.</p><p>Police said LeCroy, who died in the wreck, was driving more than 100 miles per hour and had a blood-alcohol concentration of .197 — more than twice the legal limit of .08.</p><p>Bowles’ lawyers said she is being retaliated against for her lawsuit.</p><figure

two in the vehicle, has been fired by the school. <span class=credit>ToryBowles/Twitter</span></figure><p>The university said in a statement that Bowles was fired for not cooperating with its investigation.</p><p>Another Georgia player, Warren McClendon, sustained only minor injuries.</p><p>Bowles, who was sitting in the backseat next to Willock, sustained serious injuries including lumbar and rib fractures, a spinal cord injury and lacerations to the kidney and liver, her lawsuit stated.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The scene of the

sustained a closed-head injury with neurological damage and severe eye pain.</p><p>The lawsuit, which includes LeCroy’s estate as an additional defendant, requests at least $171,595 in general damages along with punitive damages.</p><p>The suit claims the Georgia athletic association entrusted a rented SUV to LeCroy and was aware that she had at least two “super speeder” violations among four speeding tickets prior to the crash.</p><p>The athletic association said staff members were authorized to use rental vehicles for recruiting purposes only.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Jalen Carter was drafted by the Eagles not long after the deadly crash. <span class=credit>USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con</span></figure><p>“Under no circumstances were recruiting staff authorized to use rental cars to drive at excessive speeds while intoxicated,” the athletic association said in a statement.</p><p>Bowles was on paid medical leave for a couple of months following the crash, before the athletic association placed her on unpaid leave in March, according to records obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p><p>Rob Buck, an attorney representing Bowles in her lawsuit, said the university has engaged in a “campaign of intimidation” against his client, whose job paid less than $12,000 a year.</p><p>“Tory, like all other perceived liabilities to the football program, became expendable to UGA, and despite her loyalty and meager salary, has been steamrolled,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image

wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The University of Georgia’s athletic association claimed Bowles was fired for not complying with an investigation into the fatal car wreck, while her attorneys said the dismissal was retaliatory. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The athletic association said in a statement Monday that while it wished Bowles well in her recovery, it was forced to fire her for lack of cooperation.</p><p>“Applicable policies require university employees to cooperate with internal investigations,” the statement obtained by the Journal-Constitution said. “Over the course of several months, Ms. Bowles was asked — on numerous occasions — to speak with our investigators and provide information, and through her attorney, she repeatedly refused to cooperate.</p><p>“As a result, we were ultimately left with no choice but to terminate her employment.”</p><p>Carter received 12 months’ probation and a $1,000 fine in March after <a href=#>pleading no contest to misdemeanor charges</a> of reckless driving and racing.</p><p>McClendon was a fifth-round pick by the Rams.</p><p>– With AP.</p><p class=postsid
